PSEXE2ROM : Convert PS1/PSX Executables To Flashable GameShark/Cheat Cart ROM files
===================================================================================

Have you ever wanted to run your own code instead of the PSX BIOS/Shell at boot on an unmodified PS1 console? This tool allows you to convert PSX executables into a ROM file that you can use to overwrite a GameShark or similar PSX cheat cart's executable with your own. Once you flash your cheat card using a tool such as [NXFlash](https://github.com/danhans42/nxflash) with the ROM file generated by PS-EXE2ROM, the cheat cart will boot that PS-EXE automatically if the cheat cart is installed in a console and you turn it on.

Usage
-----

PSEXE2ROM is a command line program That requires 2 arguments. The program is the `psexe2rom.exe` (Windows) or `psexe2rom` (Linux) file in the releases downloadable from above.

The first argument is the PS-EXE file you want to run on your GameShark or other cheat device. The second argument is the name/path of the ROM file that you want to make out of the PS-EXE file you specify in the first argument. Example usage below:

_Linux (In Terminal)_

    ./psexe2rom my.exe my.rom

_Windows (In CMD.EXE)_

    psexe2rom.exe my.exe my.rom

PS1 cheat carts like the GameShark have capacities of either 128KB, 256KB, or 512KB (such as the GameShark Pro v3.0). However due to the fact that the loader that runs the PS-EXE on the cheat cart takes up space itself, the actual max PS-EXE file size you can use is slightly less:

*   512KB Cheat Device: 523,264 bytes
*   256KB Cheat Device: 261,120 bytes
*   128KB Cheat Device: 130,048 bytes

If you specify a PS-EXE file bigger then 523,264 bytes psexe2rom will refuse to work and tell you that your executable specified as the first argument is too large to be converted into a ROM. Otherwise PSEXE2ROM will generate a ROM file that is exactly 128KB, 256KB, or 512KB in size depending on what is the smallest capacity size that the EXE can fit in.

Flashing The ROM
----------------

There are many ways you can flash the ROM file you make with PSEXE2ROM to your PS1 cheat cart. One way is to use a serial cable to transfer the ROM file from your computer to your PS1 console using a program like [UNIROM](https://unirom.github.io) or [NXFlash](https://github.com/danhans42/nxflash). If you do not have a serial cable, you can instead create a [NXFlash](https://github.com/danhans42/nxflash) CD that contains the NXFlash PS1 software, a SYSTEM.CNF file and your ROM file. You can then boot the CD on your PS1 console, plug in your PS1 cheat device, and then flash the ROM file found on the CD to your PS1 cheat device. You can make the CD image with mkpsxiso.
